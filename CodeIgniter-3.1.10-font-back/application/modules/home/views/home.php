        Being overweight in later life puts you at higher risk of brain decline, 
        Korean research suggests.
        <br /><br />
        A study of 250 people aged between 60 and 70 found those with a high 
        body mass index (BMI) and big waists scored more poorly in cognitive tests.
        <br /><br />
        The Alzheimer's Society said the research, in the journal Age and Ageing,
        added to evidence that excess body fat can affect brain function.
        <br /><br />
        Lifestyle changes can help make a difference, it said.
        <br /><br />
        The study looked at the relationship between fat levels and cognitive 
        performance in adults aged 60 or over.
        <br /><br />
        The participants underwent BMI - a calculation based on a ratio of weight
        to height - and waist circumference measurements, a scan of fat stored in
        the abdomen and a mental test.
        <br /><br />
        Both a high BMI and high levels of abdominal fat were linked with poor 
        cognitive performance in adults aged between 60 and 70.
        <br /><br />
        In individuals aged 70 and older, high BMI, waist circumference and abdominal
        body fat were not associated with low cognitive performance.
        <br /><br />
        The lead author of the study, Dae Hyun Yoon, said: "Our findings have important 
        public health implications. The prevention of obesity, particularly central 
        obesity, might be important for the prevention of cognitive decline or dementia."
        <br /><br />
        A spokesperson from the UK Alzheimer's Society said: "We have all heard how a
        high BMI is bad for our heart but this research suggests it could also be 
        bad for the head.
        <br /><br />
        "Although we don't know whether the people in
        this study went on to develop dementia, these findings add to the evidence 
        that excess body fat could impact on brain function.
        <br /><br />
        "One in three people over 65 will die with dementia but there are things 
        people can do to reduce their risk.
        <br /><br />
        "Eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly
        and getting your blood pressure and cholesterol checked can all make a difference."
